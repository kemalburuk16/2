    <h4 class="mt-4">12) Disclaimers</h4>
    <p>The Service is provided “<strong>as is</strong>” and “<strong>as available</strong>” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including accuracy, availability, non‑infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Your use is at your sole risk.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">13) Limitation of Liability</h4>
