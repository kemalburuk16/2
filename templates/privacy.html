    <h4 class="mt-4">4) Retention</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essential session data</strong> is kept only while necessary for your active session.</li>
      <li><strong>Rate‑limiting/security artifacts</strong> (e.g., short rolling time windows keyed to IP) are kept for the minimum period needed to protect the Service and are regularly rotated.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong> respect your consent and follow provider retention defaults (aggregated/pseudonymous form).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal correspondence</strong> is retained as long as reasonably necessary to comply with law and enforce our rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">5) Cookies & Similar Technologies</h4>
    <p>We use strictly necessary cookies and, with your consent, analytics and advertising cookies. See our detailed
      <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for categories, examples, and controls (including a live cookie viewer and a one‑click delete option).</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">6) Sharing & Processors</h4>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data with service providers (e.g., analytics, anti‑abuse, hosting, email)
       strictly to operate and secure the Service, under contractual safeguards (including Standard Contractual Clauses where relevant).</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">7) International Transfers</h4>
    <p>When data is transferred outside your jurisdiction (e.g., to the United States), we rely on appropriate safeguards such as SCCs and provider security commitments.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">8) Your Rights</h4>
    <p><strong>EEA/UK users</strong> may request access, correction, erasure, portability, restriction, or objection, and may withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior processing.
       <strong>US (California)</strong> users have CPRA rights including access, deletion, and the right to opt out of “sharing” for cross‑context advertising. We do not sell personal information.</p>
    <p>To exercise rights, contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@instavido.com">privacy@instavido.com</a> (or use the Privacy Request tab on the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page).</p>
    <p><strong>Global Privacy Control (GPC)/Do Not Track:</strong> Where supported, we interpret GPC/“Do Not Track” as an opt‑out from non‑essential cookies.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">9) Children</h4>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or under the age of digital consent where applicable). We use an age‑gate and do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
