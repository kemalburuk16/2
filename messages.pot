"An Instagram Story is a temporary piece of visual content — photo or "
"video — that disappears after 24 hours. It appears at the top of your "
"feed and is used to share quick updates, behind-the-scenes moments, or "
"time-sensitive content. Unlike regular posts, stories are not displayed "
"permanently on your profile unless added to highlights. Stories can "
"include text, music, polls, and interactive elements. They are a powerful"
" way to stay connected in real-time."
